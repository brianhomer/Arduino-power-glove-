Arduino-power-glove-
====================
This is a simple project by using arduino , flex sensor and some small parts which printed by 3D printer., Then you can control the robot arm. IN my case I am using Inmoov his design and this is a good design and you can visit him in the following link

http://inmoov.blogspot.hk/

you need the following materials before you start
1) An arduino board I am using the simple duemilanove.

2) flex sensors (2.2" X 3; 4.5" X2) for which you can bought those from www.sparkfun.com

3) printed the necessary parts from www.thingiverse.com the flex sensor guide

4) Refer to the attached diagram and connected the circuitry

5) printed the Inmoov robot arm and connect the servos as is.

6) programming the arduino with enclosed program.

7) check out my youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlC5OT_ICA&list=UUqP9DZZAqsX5uon0FPYsAag&index=3
as a reference and you may need adjust the tension of cable or the servo horn position by yourself.

8) Then all done


Using arduino to control the robot arm.
